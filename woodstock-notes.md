# Sheffield Build

## Flooring

We need around 50m length of floorboards to replace the ones we’ve damaged renovating the house. They were tongue and groove so a right pain to get out.

On top of this, we’ve got MDF boards down in the loft, which don’t look great. [How much m2?]

### Custom planks cut online

You can get wooden planks cut online, to a specified thickness and width.

This works out at **£23 - 30 per meter** for oak or ash (both hardwood). They’d likely look pretty snazzy and be tough. It might be hard to match them to the existing boards.

The companies that cut these are [add links here].

### Make them out of hardwood ply

You can order 8’ x 4’ sheets of hardwood ply, 18, 15 or 12mm thick. You could then run them through a table saw or use a rail saw to cut them into the desired width (6.5”).

4’ = 48”, so with planks at 6.5”, you’d get 7 lengths from each board.

8’ ~ 2.4 meters, so that’s ~ 16 meters length per board.

A board costs ~£30.

That’s **£2 per meter**. A lot cheaper. Probably be ok if painting the boards (like in the loft).

Arnold Laver sell the boards, but don’t deliver, nor cut them.

B&Q sell boards, and cut them, first 5 cuts are free.

### Carpeting the loft room.

We’re still toying with the idea of carpeting the loft room, which would cost around £600 (including going into the storage spaces).

We got samples from Naked Flooring and liked [which?] the most.
